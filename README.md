# Pothole-Detection
Pothole Detection and Dimension Estimation , where we estimated the length and breadth of a pothole

# Steps

1. Preprocessing : we used two datasets from kaggle respectively [dataset1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitholian/annotated-potholes-dataset) and [dataset2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pothole-detection) and merged them.

2. Bounding Box technique for masking the potholes and detecting it.

3. Model Training : 20 epochs for training.

4. Model Prediction and Dimention Estimation : We calculated the focal length of pothole using bounding box coordinates , and estimated the length,width and area of pothole
